# Kaggle-Competitions
Repo to store all the competition updates from kaggle

## Repository Structure:
- Current Competitions: 
  * Current/<Comp_name>/notebook.ipynb
  * Current/<Comp_name>/submission.csv
- Previous Competitions:
  * Previous/<Comp_name>/notebook.ipynb
  * Previous/<Comp_name>/submission.csv

**NOTE:** The code for any competition has been modified over many iterations. I'll try my best to store them all. And **submission.csv** will contain the latest results submitted.
